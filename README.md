# Denoising Autoencoder
This is a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder trained on the MNIST dataset.


## Libraries used
tensorflow 1.9

keras 2.2

python 3.6

matplotlib 2.2.2

h5py 2.7.1

numpy 1.14.5

**Results are plotted in the result notebook.**

Logically, the difference between the cleaned image and real image should be as close to zero as possible.

With a deeper network and more data the autoencoder can certainly perform better.
